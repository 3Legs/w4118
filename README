Branches:
        1. hw2.This is our steady codebase. We will merge the progress into it after we reach each milestone in the homework requirment. No one should commit/push/merge/send-pull-request directly to this branch.
        
        2. dev.This is our development branch. Each member can (only) send a Pull Request from your account to this branch. That means: 1) please do not push to this branch. 2) please do not merge into this branch. 3) only send pull request in order to do code review/comments/discussion.

Workflow:
        1. Always pull 3legs/dev before you start doing something new.
        2. After you're done with something. Commit it with meaningful message (and perhaps merge it to dev if you work on your own branches) locally. Then push it to <YOUR ACCOUNT>.
        3. Send a pull request if others are going to need it through github. Others are responsible to review/test it before merge it into 3Legs/dev.
